## 📌 Overview

**NSE-Neuron** is a command-line application that fetches historical stock data from the **NSE (National Stock Exchange of India)** and uses state-of-the-art deep learning models to forecast the next **5 trading days** of stock prices — including **High**, **Low**, **Close**, and **Previous Close** values.

When **LSTM** is selected, an additional **LSTM Classifier** automatically runs in the background to provide **BUY / HOLD / SELL** signals with confidence percentages for each predicted day.

## ✨ Features

- 📈 **Multi-column forecasting** — predicts High, Low, Close, and Prev Close simultaneously
- 🕯️ **Candlestick chart** with historical OHLC data and overlaid forecast line
- 🤖 **BUY / HOLD / SELL signals** via LSTM Classifier (auto-runs with LSTM option)
- 🗓️ **Future business dates** shown in forecast table (skips weekends automatically)
- 🔌 **4 algorithm choices** — LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM
- 🏁 **Run All mode** — runs all 4 algorithms together, compares close price forecasts side-by-side and ranks them by RMSE benchmark

## 🧠 Models

| # | Algorithm | Class | Best For |
|---|-----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | **LSTM** + Classifier | `LSTMModel` | Baseline; includes BUY/SELL/HOLD signals |
| 2 | **Bidirectional LSTM** | `BiLSTMModel` | Captures both past & future context in window |
| 3 | **GRU** | `GRUModel` | Fast convergence; strong performer on **shorter history** datasets |
| 4 | **CNN-LSTM** | `CNNLSTMModel` | Best accuracy on **large datasets**; CNN extracts local patterns, LSTM captures long-range trends |

> ### 📊 How to pick the right model
>
> The best model depends on **how much historical data is available** for the symbol.
> Use **Run All (option 5)** to let the benchmark decide automatically.
>
> | Available History | Recommended Model | Why |
> |-------------------|-------------------|---|
> | **< 5 years**     | BiLSTM             | Bidirectional context adds value with larger sequence windows|
> | **5 – 15 years**  | GRU               | Lightweight design converges well on medium-sized sequences  |
> | **15+ years**     | CNN-LSTM          | Enough data for CNN to extract meaningful local patterns before LSTM learns trends |
>
> **Bottom line:** CNN-LSTM is the most powerful architecture, but it needs sufficient historical data (15+ years) to outperform simpler models. On smaller datasets, GRU or LSTM's lightweight design gives them the edge.

## 📋 Usage

**Step 1** — Enter a valid NSE stock symbol (e.g. `INFY`, `RELIANCE`, `PNB`, `TCS`)

```
Enter the NSE Share Symbol:- INFY

Select the algorithm for forecasting:
1. LSTM with Classifier
2. BiLSTM
3. GRU
4. CNN-LSTM
Selection: 1
```

**Step 2** — Select the forecasting algorithm

**Output** — A forecast table and an interactive candlestick + forecast plot are displayed:
